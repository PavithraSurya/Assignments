1. 	what is a decorator in Python, explain with example.

2.	What is closure in python
Ans:    If we access the parameter from outside function to inside function, this is called closure.

3. 	When to use Python Closures and their benefits
Ans: Closures can be used to avoid the unnecessary use of class. 
     Closures can also be used to avoid the use of global variable.
     The only way to access the inner function is by calling the outer function. 
     Benifits: Data hiding is an important use of closures.     
               Closures are useful because they let us associate data with a function that operates on that data.

4. 	What is module in python
        Modules are python files containing Python code that can be

    f = os.path.join(path_of_the_directory,filename)
    if os.path.isfile(f):
