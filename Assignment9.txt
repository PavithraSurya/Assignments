1)How can you interact with MySQL?

To interact with MySQL, use CMD or Anaconda prompt and use below commands to execute  the queries.
mysql -u root -p( if password is given)
enter the password: ******
After we can excecute the SQL queries

To interact from Python use the Library Sqlalchemy


2) What is the difference between TRUNCATE TABLE and DROP TABLE and DELETE Queries in MySQL
The DROP TABLE command deletes the complete table in the database.
Eg; DROP TABLE <TABLE_NAME>;

The TRUNCATE TABLE command deletes the whole data inside a table, but not the table itself. Its execution is faster than Delete command.
eg: TRUNCATE TABLE stu;


The DELETE command is used to delete the existing records in a table based on condition, without conditio we can delete entire data in table.
Eg: To delete the row in table
DELETE FROM students WHERE student_Id=2;


3) What are CRUD operations, explain with queries.

CRUD -- create, read, update and drop

To Create Database
CREATE DATABASE City;

To create Tables;
CREATE TABLE Student(Student_Id int,Student_Name varchar(255),Student_Branch varchar(255),Student_Batch varchar(255));

To Read(select) data in the table
select * from Student;
select * from students WHERE student_Branch LIKE 'CSE';

To UPDATE values of column using values within table
UPDATE car_data1 SET color=car_data1.index+ 20;
UPDATE students SET Student_Name="Kashu" WHERE Student_Id=4;

To delete Database
DROP DATABASE City;


4) What are the Temporal Data Types in MySQL?
Temporal Data Types is a data type in MySQL to reperesent date, time, year and intervals.


5)Explain BLOB in MySQL? Explain with queries.

A BLOB is a binary large object that can hold a large amount of data which includes objects such as images and multimedia files.
The four BLOB types are TINYBLOB , BLOB , MEDIUMBLOB , and LONGBLOB.

CREATE TABLE data_type_details
(
id INT PRIMARY KEY,
name VARCHAR(255),
description BLOB
);

The data_type_details table has been successfully created with a description field of BLOB data type.


6)How to check the MySQL version?
By logging into mysql shell it provides version name.

give command in any prompt ->> mysql -V

7)How to join three tables in MySQL? Explain with queries
add a second INNER JOIN statement and a second ON statement to indicate the third table and the second relationship.

SELECT * FROM car_data1 INNER JOIN students ON car_data1.year = students.Student_Batch INNER JOIN dummy ON students.Student_Batch = dummy.Student_Batch;


8)What is the difference between primary key and foriegn key? Explain with queries
Primary key is column name in the table which has unique and non null values.
Foriegn key is column name which is compared to primary key of another table.
The table with the foreign key is called the child table, and the table with the primary key is called as parent table.
combination will be primary key , combination will be UNIQUE

Eg: This is for primary key
CREATE TABLE Docu(
	Student_Id int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,    
	Student_Name varchar(255) ,
Student_Branch varchar(255),
PRIMARY KEY (Student_Id));

CREATE TABLE Trial(
	Student_Id int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, 
	Student_Ref_num int ,
Student_Branch varchar(255),
PRIMARY KEY (Student_Id),
FORIEGN KEY (Student_Ref_num) REFERENCES Docu((Student_Id));


9)What is the difference bettwen Auto incrementment Key, Unique Key and Primary key? Explain with queries
Auto incrementment Key : once this is set to any field it starts from 1 and increment by 1 for next entry. Values will be Unique. 
                         We can set the initial value. If there is one auto increment key in the table by default it will be primary key.

Eg: CREATE TABLE Person(
	Person_Id int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,       
	Person_Name varchar(20) ,
	Student_Place varchar(50),
        PRIMARY KEY (Student_Id));
 
Unique Key: All values in a column are different( do not repeat/ Not null), as unique Table can have more than one unique key. 
            unique key does not supports Auto increment value. We can change unique key values.
EG: CREATE TABLE Person(
	Person_Id int,
	Person_Name varchar(20) ,
	Student_Place varchar(50),
        CONSTRAINT Identification UNIQUE (Person_Id );

Primary key:  Primary key is a column of table which identifies each row in that table.
              Primary key supports auto increment value. We cannot change or delete values stored in primary keys like in Unique key.
              Primary key of one table can be referenced by foreign key of another table. 
             If there is more than one auto increment key we have to specify oe auto-increment as the primary key.

Eg: CREATE TABLE Person(
	Person_AAdhar num int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,  
        Person_Election ID int NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,       
	Person_Name varchar(20) ,
	Student_Place varchar(50),
        PRIMARY KEY (Person_AAdhar num));




10)What is the difference between SQL and MySQL?
SQL is a query programming language. It is used to operate database systems
MySQL is a software and relational database management system that uses SQL.

11)How to check database size in MySQL? Explain with queries
To check database size in MySQL enter below command
select table_schema `Database`, Round(Sum(data_length + index_length) / 1024 / 1024, 1) `Size in MB` FROM information_schema.TABLES GROUP BY table_schema;
 
12)How to change/rename the table name in MySQL? Explain with queries
To rename the table name we have to use alter and rename command
EG: alter table car_data rename to fake;


13)How to change/rename the DB name in MySQL? Explain with queries
To change or ename the data base use RENAME  or ALTER. ( Below commands are not working)
Eg: RENAME DATABASE sys MODIFY NAME=sysm;  
    ALTER DATABASE sys MODIFY NAME=sysm;
