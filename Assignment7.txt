What is the difference between list and tuples in Python?
Both comes under sequence.
List: List is Mutable and hence have several methods to edit the data. Stores duplicates values and elemensts can be accessed using indes value.
      It denoted by square bracketes. Dynamic in nature.
Tuple: Immutable, denoted by small brackets. Static in nature. can also have duplicate entries

What are Keywords in Python?
Keywords are reserved words which we cannot use as variable or function name.

What are python iterato
Iterators is the object which can traverse through all the values and stores data in a sequence. To print values use keyword
 next which gives only one value at a time.

What are Python packages?
Python package is collection of modules.

What is the difference between deep and shallow copy?
In Shallow Copy, copies and the original object shares the same memory address. If any changes made in copied object reflects in original as well.
In Deep copy, copied object will be in different memory. Any changes made to copied object will not reflect in original object. 

How to import modules in python?
Use the keyword import and module name
eg: to import regular expression module
import re

What do you mean by Python literals
Literals are raw data or values that can stored in variables.It can numbers, strings, boolean data.

Create a dictorany using zip() function
keys = ['Toy', 'price','shop name',manuf date']
values = ['doll', 25,'Aurelia','30 Sep']
Dy = dict(zip(keys, values))
print(Dy)


How to overload constructors or methods in Python?
Using Decorators method we can overload since decorator extends the functionality behavior. Another method is to change the input literal ,
so that the same function name executes based on the input type.

What is the difference between remove() function and del statement?
Removes()- It removes the first matching element using the value
eg remove('a')
wheras del delete the values using the index.eg: del[0]

How to remove leading whitespaces from a string in the Python?
Usinf strip function. rstrip removes rightside spaces and lstrip removes left spaces

What are the rules for a local and global variable in Python?
Local variable -varialbe whose usage is restricted within the function .
Global varialbe- This variable can be used anywhere in the program and not restriced to one specific function.


What is a generator in Python?
Generators is a function in Python which are used to create iterators and return a iterable object.
It helps in traversing all the items one at a time with the help of the keyword yield(return is not used since it terminates the function)


What is a  in Python?
a is used in regular expression. a is used to append the file.

Explain pass, continue and break statements
In Loops, pass  does not break or do anything, it iterates till last number.
Continue: It will break the current iteration once condition satisfies. Print statement will be skipped for current iteration.
break: It breaks the iteration once the condition satisfies.

Print the elements in a list using for loop in reverse way

List1=[23,45,67,12,9,72]
RL=[]
count=6
for i in range(len(6,0):
    print(RL(i))
    count-=1
   

Explain the comiple(), split(), sub(), and subn() methods of the Python "re" module. 
compile() method is used to compile a regular expression pattern provided as a string into a regex pattern object ( re. Pattern ). 
Later we can use this pattern object to search for a match inside different target strings using re.
split() – uses a regex pattern to “split” a given string into a list.
sub() – finds all substrings where the regex pattern matches and then replace them with a different string.
subn() – being similar to sub() it also returns the new string along with the number of replacements.


Reverse a string in python
Considering the A as string value. A([::-1]) gives reverse string

Read the contents of Excel File using xlrd module
xlrd- Module is used to readinf files and formating information from data files in xls format.

To read the content
import xlrd
# To open work book
WB=xlrd.open_workbook('filename.xlsx')  # filename.xlsx is the file we wish to open

work_sheet = WB.sheet_by_index(sheet_index)
variable worksheet reference to the sheet by index sheet_index, where sheet_index specifies the index of the sheet we wish to open.

worksheet.cell_value(row,column)
Above command is used to get the value of the cell row, column position in the excel file.


Read the contents of Excel File using import PyPDF2
PyPDF2: It is a python library used for performing major tasks on PDF files.

Create file1 using 'open()' function and write contents to it.
New_file=open('file1.txt',w)
New_file.write('This is the new file and writing the content in it') 


Copy the contents of file1 to contents of file2 
Can copy one file content to another fiile content by shutil method.
eg; import shutil
    shutil.copyfile('file.txt','file2.txt')(should mention destination not file name)

Copy all files present in one directory to another using os and shutil modules
import os, shutil
 
# path to source directory
src_dir = 'fol1'
 
# path to destination directory
dest_dir = 'fol2'
 
# getting all the files in the source directory
files = os.listdir(src_dir)
 
shutil.copytree(src_dir, dest_dir)


What is a lambda function? Give an example of when it’s useful and when it’s not
Lambda is a one liner function
Lambda function is useful 1) for simple logical operations, oters can understand easily 2) if we are using  function for one time
Lamba function cannot be used 1) if we have many argumments  2) in nested functions
               

Explain inheritance and types of inheritances in Python with an example
Inheritance allows the class to inherits all the methods and properties from another class.
Multiple inheritance and multilevel inhheritance


How would you sort a dictionary in Python
import collections
for k, v in od.iteritems(): 
print k, v

or

color_dict= {'red':'#FF0000',
          'green':'#008000',
          'black':'#000000',
          'white':'#FFFFFF'}

for key in sorted(color_dict):
    print("%s: %s" % (key, color_dict[key]))


Write program for Factorial Numbers
a=input(int('Enter the number:'))
count=0
x=true
while(x)
count+=1
Fact=a*(a-1)
if count==a:
    x=false
print(fact)


Write program for Anagram
sort both the strings and compare
x="sarita"
y="barita"

x.sort
y.sort
if x==y:
    print('Two strings are anagram")
else
    print("not Anagram")

Write program for Armstrong Numbers

n=input(int(entr the value:')

sum=0

for i in len(n)
    i=i**3
    sum =sum+0
    if i=len(n): 
        break
print(sum)
if Sum =n
    print("this is Armstrong")
else:
    print(not)
   

Look  into the module itertools
Itertools is a module in Python, it is used to iterate over data structures.This module incorporates functions. 
This can ve used for grouping the data, to set combinations in data, pemutation of elements, flattening lists(removes grouping and gives in single list)

Look  into the module collections
Python has built in module called collections which has specialised data structures which covers the short coming of 4 data types(List,Tuple, sets, dict).
collections module provides additional data structures for collections of data.
